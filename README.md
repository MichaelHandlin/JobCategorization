# Job Categorization

This project provides examples of different implementations of machine learning to categorize various user-provided LinkedIn job titles. Each job title in our dataset was encoded using (Universal Sentence Encoder)[https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4] by Google and then associated with one of 28 IT-related categories. 

Special thanks to Dr. Linh Le of Kennesaw State University for writing this code and proiding some much needed advice to this project's success.
